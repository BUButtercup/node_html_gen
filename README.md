# node_html_gen

Project Purpose: the purpose of this project was to learn to use the npm inquirer package to generate new html files with user input, and very simply customized CSS. 

Set Up: the file package includes the JSON package with required npm downloads. The only required package is 'inquirer'. In order to answer the questions, you will need your contact information (please enter phone with '-' as in 555-555-5555), and both your GitHub and Linked in usernames and profile links on hand.

Use Instructions: to use this project, after the initial download and upon running the app, you will answer a series of questions. A personalized HTML and CSS file with the information you provided posted in it will be provided, using the color choice you made and a dev-selected complimentary color. If you provided accurate contact and link information, the contact information links should all work to either email or call you directly upon click, or take you to the afore-mentioned profiles.

Future Development Ideas: Currently, this application is very simple in both the output and choices provided, and the colors used are a bit garish. With some fleshing out of the information asked for, and with the introduction of more sophisticated styling choices (maybe the use of a framework like Bootstrap), this could be turned into a personalized digital resume generator.
